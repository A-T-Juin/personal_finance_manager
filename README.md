# Finance manager

This repository is reserved for the backend portion of Finance Manager. It is a project that, in theory, should help one with their finances through data visualization.

## Motivation

This project was started when I was thinking of problems I have come across before in my life. In my younger years, I did not really have a way of tracking my spendings other than viewing my bank statements -- and even then, it just felt that there was something missing. This was what I sought out to fix, in my own vision, with Finance Manager.
